# 🧑‍💻 GitHub Profile Viewer

A sleek and functional GitHub profile viewer built with **React + Vite**, designed to help users explore any GitHub user's profile, including their bio and repositories. The project aims to provide a simple yet engaging UI, with a stretch goal of implementing an **AI-powered assistant** to offer conversational insights about the viewed profile.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Search GitHub Users** - Quickly search for any GitHub user by their username.

✅ **User Profile Overview** - Displays the user's profile information including name, avatar, location, and bio.

✅ **Repositories Listing** - Lists all public repositories with name, description, star count, and forks.

✅ **Responsive UI** - Mobile-first and desktop-ready layout with modern UI design using TailwindCSS.

✅ **View More Toggle** - Show only a few repositories by default with an option to "View All Repositories".

## 🔮 Coming Soon: AI-Powered GitHub Assistant

An interactive **AI agent** that will allow users to ask questions about the person's GitHub activity, projects, and contributions. This feature will leverage LLMs to generate intelligent responses based on fetched GitHub data.

💡 *Example use cases:*
* "What kind of projects does this person work on?"
* "Summarize this user's most popular repository."
* "Is this developer focused on frontend or backend?"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React** (with Hooks and Context API)
* **Vite** (for lightning-fast development and build)
* **TailwindCSS** (for styling)
* **GitHub API** (for fetching user and repo data)
* **React Context** (for global state management)
* **Planned AI Integration**: Gemini or OpenAI (TBD)
